Hi! In this entry I want to share a little project I have developed with web programming basic techniques.

This is a very common project carried out in the introductory phases of web programming and consists of the implementation of a page that allows the management of a to-do list. In my case, I have decided to give it a differentiating touch with respect to other similar projects by allowing the inclusion of the priority of each task, where this is represented by the colour with which each task is added to the list. In addition to being able to add, delete and mark tasks as completed, the application allows you to change the priority of the tasks.

The project has been coded with the basis of the werb programming: html, css and javascript and it consists on a single page web. The only framework used is
<a href = "https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> and the project link is <a href = "https://todo-list-phi-five.vercel.app/">todo list</a>
