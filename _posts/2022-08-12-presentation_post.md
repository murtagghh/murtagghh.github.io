Hello world! In this first post I would like to introduce myself. I'm VÃ­ctor, a young graduate in Computer Engineering and Statistics from the University of Valladolid, Spain. In this webpage I will show my projects and insights on the data science, data analysis, machine learning and software development worlds, as well as my updated resume and the certificates I get. I hope you find it interesting!
