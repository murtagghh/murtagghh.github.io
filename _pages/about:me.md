I'm VÃ­ctor, graduate in Computer Engineering and Statistics from de University of Valladolid, Spain (Jul 2022). This is my personal website to post my projects and insights in the data science, data analytics, machine learning and software development worlds.<br><br> 
I'm really passionate about the data world and about everything surrounding software development. I really enjoy coding. I believe that I have acquired skills and abilities that I consider to be of particular value to any company interested in hiring me.<br><br> 
I have strong programming skills in <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>R</strong> and <strong>Java</strong>, as well as working with relational databases with <strong>SQL</strong> (MySQL and PostreSQL). I have a little experience working with <strong>Docker</strong> containers in my Final Degree Projects and also with other important tools such as <strong>Excel</strong> (including macro programming with <strong>Visual Basic for Applications</strong>), <strong>AMPL solver</strong>, <strong>Power Bi</strong>. Currently I'm working as a junior analyst programmer in Santander Consumer Finance Global Services, where I am improving my web development skills such as <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong> and <strong>Javascript</strong> in the fontend side, specially working with <strong>React.js</strong>, working with <strong>Java Spring Boot</strong> in the backend side (also working with Jhipster) and using PostgreSQL for everything related to databases. I love working in <strong>Linux</strong> environments but i can also work with MacOS, Windows and with the Office tools.<br><br>
I'm in a constant learning process and I see myself as a person who takes initiative, who loves working as a team and that stays curious about everything that surrounds me. I love sports and I play in a football team and I also enjoy travelling, reading and spending time with my close ones.<br><br>
