I'm VÃ­ctor, graduate in Computer Engineering and Statistics from de University of Valladolid, Spain (Jul 2022). This is my personal website to post my projects and insights in the data science, data analytics, machine learning and software development worlds.<br><br> 
I'm really passionate abount the data world and I also enjoy coding a lot. I believe that during my recent time as a student I have acquired skills and abilities that I consider to be of particular value to any company interested in hiring me.<br><br> 
I have strong programming skills in <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>R</strong> and also good level coding in <strong>Java</strong> and <strong>SAS</strong> and working with relational databases with <strong>SQL</strong>. I have experience working with <strong>Docker</strong> containers in my Final Degree Projects and also with other important tools such as <strong>Excel</strong> (including macro programming with <strong>Visual Basic for Applications</strong>), <strong>AMPL solver</strong>, <strong>Power Bi</strong> and web development technologies such as <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong> and <strong>Javascript</strong>. I love working in <strong>Linux</strong> environments but i can also work with Windows and with the Office tools.<br><br>
As I have studies in Data Science that is the field in which I would like to pursue my professional career, but currently I think that the most important issue for me is learning new things. That is why I may also be interested in positions that may be less linked to artificial intelligence or machine learning.<br><br>
I'm in a constant learning process and I see myself as a person who takes initiative, who loves working as a team and that stays curious about everything that surrounds me. I love sports and I play in a football team and I also enjoy travelling, reading and spending time with my close ones.<br><br>
